SHORT FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS (post v1.0)
-------------------------------------

- Tree functions execute piped commands (grep, awk) on master when launched on remote slave which can cause more bandwith usage
- Fast sync mode should also work with remote systems

FAR FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
-----------------------

- Rethink of .osync_workdir/state/* files with PIDs, Host and Task Names to better identify multiple instances on the same fileset
- Improve Master / Slave schema to Multimaster schema
- Sync and delete propagation function merge (master and slave functions are the same, reduces code size and maintain effort)
- Tree function merge (current and after tree functions are the same except for output filename and logging, reduces code size and maintain effort)
- Master replica may also exist on remote host

KNOWN ISSUES
------------

- None yet, need more testing on MSYS environment
